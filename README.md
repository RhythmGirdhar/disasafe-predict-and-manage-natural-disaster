### ABSTRACT
Considering the current scenario where disaster relief is still a topic of major concern, We have decided to develop an application for
the same. The given application ' Disasafe ' focuses mainly on locating the site of the disaster and also providing immediate 
source of communication to the concerned authorities(during the disaster). But, most importantly Prevention is always better than cure, 
hence, We are also going to take up the task of predicting the disaster beforehand. By Using the State-of-Art techniques in Machine         Learning along with principles of Image recognition, we will be able to predict a natural disaster in the near future using already fed     Satellite Images.

### DETAILS
There are 2 Different parts in our given solution.  
* **Part 1: Relief Management During The Disaster**
  - We have a **Web Based Application** where all the users from the disaster-prone regions can register at any time. 
  - On registration, you have to give **3 contact details** of the nearest ones. 
  - As we are tracking your location all the time (with permission, which can be disabled at user's discretion), if the user is close - by or at the disaster location itself, the **location of the user will be sent** along with the disaster type to the three given contacts. 
  - The most difficult part is to identify the affected areas during the calamity, we will be using the **Convolutional Neural Network** which is the state-of-Art technology for Image recognition. We will tag the type of disaster using the Almost real time images obtained from  **NOAAâ€™s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)**. 
  - The Dashboard section of every user's profile allows them to obtain their **exact location, Use Cab Services, flight services, local bus services to evacuate the given area as soon as possible.** 
  - It also includes the quick calling facility in order to contact all the known *emergency/relief phone numbers*.
  - The **Discussion Forum** allows people to share their past experiences/grievances on this public platform to help other people in need. It has Category wise segregation of sub topics along with keyword tagging for faster and seemless usage of the forum. Each sub-topic has a post-reply system for sharing experiences.
  
* **Part 2: Predicting The Area Of Disaster**
  - We will be using **Deep learning Algorithms** to label and tag the GeoSatellite images. 
  - We will keep observing the weather patterns and terrestrial changes and whenever there is a hit of any **abnormal activity** in the images, we will be alerting the Concerned authorities. 
  - The satellite images from the given Geosatellite is fed to our Deep Learning System, it starts **classifying the images to different labels/tag**. Since it's dynamic in nature, we will keep observing the labels.
  - If any one of the image is classified as a Natural Disaster, it could be a probable hit.
  - Now the **location is sent to every concerned authority** so that they can take further action. The UI for the authorities will be simple and they have to register themselves.
  - When there is a potential hit, we will notify them of the location and probable type of the calamity.

 ### CONCLUSION
 We have incorporated all the required services which will be of real help to the users. The prototype will be ready to use post its deployment.
